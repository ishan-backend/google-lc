/*
NP Hard Problem: (With bitmasking we will be able to relax the TC by some measure)

Given cities and distances between each pair of cities (two-way costs).
Shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to origin city.

Starts from city 1.
Visit each city from 2..N exactly once, and then he'll be coming back home i.e. city 1

Design a tour, such that overall cost is minimised.
